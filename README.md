# Atea.MaintenanceMode
OpsMgr 2012 (SCOM 2012) Manegement Pack, Windows Desktop Client and Installer Projects to set maintenance mode from within a monitored system.

## About the naming

I am a big proponent of separating namespaces and since I have developed this package as an employee of Atea Sverige AB I have chosen to use Atea.* as the namespace for most of my management packs.
This project is uploaded to Github under the MIT-license, so feel free to fork and modify as you like.

## Acknowledgements

Inspired by, and initially based on [Natasha Heil's](https://systemcentertipps.wordpress.com/) [management pack](http://www.systemcentercentral.com/pack-catalog/sample-agent-maintenance-mode-2012-mp/), although the formatting of the eventlog message is pretty much the only thing left.
Go pay her a visit, her blog is full of usefull System Center stuff!
